ðŸš‘ Ambulance Sensor Detector â€“ Java + Arduino Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates a smart traffic signal system that detects ambulances and automatically turns the signal green to allow them to pass.

It uses:

Java (for decision-making â€“ simulating sound and distance readings)

Arduino (for controlling real LEDs representing traffic lights)

When the system detects:

Ambulance detected â†’ Green light ON (Red OFF)

No ambulance â†’ Red light ON (Green OFF)

This demonstrates how IoT + Java programming can be used for smart city traffic control.

ðŸ›  Requirements
Hardware
Arduino Uno / Nano / Mega

1 Ã— Red LED

1 Ã— Green LED

2 Ã— 220Î© Resistors

Breadboard + jumper wires

USB cable to connect Arduino to PC

Software
Java IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code with Java)

Arduino IDE (latest version)

jSerialComm library for Java (download: https://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/)

âš¡ Circuit Diagram
Connections:

Red LED â†’ Pin 8 (through 220Î© resistor to GND)

Green LED â†’ Pin 9 (through 220Î© resistor to GND)

Connect Arduino to PC via USB

ðŸ–¼ Visual Example:
Arduino Pin 8 ---[220Î©]---|>|--- GND  (Red LED)
Arduino Pin 9 ---[220Î©]---|>|--- GND  (Green LED)
â–¶ How to Run
Build Circuit (LEDs, resistors, Arduino).

Upload Arduino Code using Arduino IDE.

Close Serial Monitor (important â€“ Java will use the port).

Run Java Code from your Java IDE.

Observe:

Console prints simulated sound & distance.

Green LED ON when ambulance detected.

Red LED ON when normal traffic.

ðŸ“¸ Demo (Optional)
Take a photo or short video of your working setup and upload it here (GitHub supports .gif or image links).

ðŸ“š Future Improvements
Use real sound sensor on Arduino instead of random data.

Add buzzer to alert nearby traffic.

Extend to multiple traffic signals with priority control.
